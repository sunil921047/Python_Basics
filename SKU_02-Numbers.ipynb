    "\n",
    "Python has various \"types\" of numbers (numeric literals). We'll mainly focus on integers and floating point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we will be mainly working with integers or simple float number types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a table of the two main types we will spend most of our time working with some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    " ( Below info by SKU)\n",
    " Python supports 3 different numerical types.\n",
    "\n",
    "int - for integer values like 1, 100, 2255, -999999, 0, 12345678.\n",
    "\n",
    "float - for floating-point values like 2.3, 3.14, 2.71, -11.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "complex - for complex numbers like 3+2j, -2+2.3j, 10j, 4.5+3.14j.)"
